bio: My name is Yanlei (Kaly) Zhang, and I am a postdoc working with RAFALES Lab (Mila), Krishnaswamy Lab (Yale University) and AIDOS Lab (Helmholtz Munich). My current research focuses on developing machine learning methodologies, drawing from mathematical theory, and applying them to biomedical discovery. By analyzing complex real-world data, I aim to bridge the gap between the rigorous abstractions of pure mathematics and practical, data-driven challenges inherent in machine learning and biological data science inquiries. My previous research focused on geometric analysis and its applications to geometric control theory.
