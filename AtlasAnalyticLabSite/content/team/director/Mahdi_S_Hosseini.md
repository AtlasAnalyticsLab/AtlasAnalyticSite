bio: Mahdi S. Hosseini is an assistant professor of computer science in department of Computer Science and Software Engineering (CSSE) at Concordia University and a faculty member of Applied AI Institute at Concordia. He received his PhD from The Edward S. Rogers Sr. Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the University of Toronto (UofT) in 2016 from Multimedia Lab under the supervision of Professor Konstantinos N. Plataniotis. He continued as a postdoctoral research fellow at UofT in collaboration with Huron Digital Pathology Inc at Waterloo Ontario. During his postdoctoral study at UofT, he received two fellowships of the MITACS-Elevate Award and NSERC research funding. Dr. Hosseini continues his collaboration with Huron Digital Pathology in the capacity of senior research scientist for transformational changes of digital pathology solutions in clinical healthcare systems. Dr. Hosseini’s research is primarily advanced in foundational developments of deep learning and computer vision algorithms which are efficiently designed for computational pathology applications. He is currently supervising several graduate students on related topics and his vision is to develop, in collaboration with hospitals and pathologists, meaningful computer aided diagnosis systems as assistive tools in clinical pathology for cancer diagnosis and treatment. He has published more than 30 papers and two patent applications in related fields. Dr. Hosseini’s reviewing services cover well-known venues in CVF foundation, ML Conferences and IEEE SPS. Dr. Hosseini is a selected Area Chair (AC) for CVPR2024, CVPR2023, NeurIPS2023, and CVPR2022.
