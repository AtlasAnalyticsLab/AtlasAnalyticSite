description: We are pleased to announce open positions for PhD students to engage in cutting edge deep learning research. The primary focus of this research is to develop **Vision-language Models (VLMs)** in deep learning for automating medical reports from gigapixel **Whole Slide Images (WSIs)** in clinical pathology. This initiative is part of highly cross-disciplinary research project, bringing together **Computer Vision (CV)** and **Natual Language Processing (NLP)** experts in deep learning as well as clinical pathologist for developing cutting edge solutions in computational pathology.
