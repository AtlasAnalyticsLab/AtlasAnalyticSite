description: "Atlas Analytics Lab explores the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques on foundation models that have been pretrained on extensive datasets. By implementing these methods in computational pathology, we aim to significantly enhance model performance on new, target datasets without the need to fine-tune the entire model. This strategy seeks to optimize resource efficiency while maintaining high accuracy in diagnostic applications."
