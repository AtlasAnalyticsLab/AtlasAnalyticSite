description: "Our research explores the application of Diffusion Generative Models (DGMs) for studying and synthesizing histopathology images. This work includes a comprehensive comparison of various diffusion generative methods, analyzing the characteristics they impart to the generated images.  Additionally, we showcase the capability of DGMs to learn patch resolution of histopathology image patches, highlighting their utility in medical imaging applications."
